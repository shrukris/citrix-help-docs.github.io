If your organization supports the smooth roaming feature, with Receiver, you can roam from one device to another and continue to work in your open Windows apps or desktop.

For example, you can log on to your Receiver account on your iPad, launch Word, and start a document. When you close Receiver on the iPad, you can start Receiver again on any device, log on to the same Receiver account and resume working from where you left off.

1. On the iPad, log on to your Receiver account, and start your apps (or desktop).
2. Tap **Settings** and then tap **Advanced**.
3. Tap **Session Sharing** and verify that this feature is enabled (default setting).
4. When you want to move to another location or device, on the toolbar, tap **Home**.
5. Tap the **Accounts** icon and then tap **Log Off** to close Receiver.
6. When prompted, choose **Disconnect** to leave the apps or desktop running on the server.
7. Go to the second device and log on to the same Receiver account. Your apps are still running, just as you left them.

!!!tip "Note"
		If session sharing is disabled or not an option (such as on the iPhone), by default, when you tap **Home**, you disconnect from the session. Your apps continue to run on the server. You can roam to another device, log on to the same Receiver account, and resume using the apps.
