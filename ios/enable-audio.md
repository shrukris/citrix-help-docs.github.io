If your organization enables audio for mobile devices, listen to the audio from meetings, training sessions, and webinars with applications in Receiver.

In Receiver, tap the **Settings** icon and enable **Audio** (that is, set it to **ON**).

This settling lets you listen only. Receiver does not offer bi-directional audio.
