You can use another iOS device (an iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch) as a remote trackpad to control Receiver apps on your iPad.

Both devices, the iPad and the iOS controlling device, must have Receiver installed. You can use pairing to control only Receiver applications on your iPad.

!!!tip "Note"
		The pairing feature is not available for any other type of wireless mouse.

1. Ensure Bluetooth or WiFi is enabled on both iOS devices.
2. On the iPad, start Receiver and start the application. From the toolbar, tap **Pair**.
3. On the iOS controlling device, in Receiver, tap **Settings**, and then tap **Advanced**. Tap **Wireless Trackpad**, and confirm the connection.
4. Drag your finger on the controlling device screen as a touch-screen mouse inside the running application on the iPad.

This pairing continues until you close the application on the iPad.
