# Rapid Development

Typically, each project, regardless of department, starts with a blank canvas. In the past, we've had style guides or red-line documentation with the goal of shaping similar online experiences, but we've never had concrete engineering artifacts to help bootstrap and accelerate projects. This is the problem Pylon is attempting to address. It is the byproduct of a collaboration between the Citrix.com development team, user experience and brand designers with the goal of allowing employees to quickly create Citrix web interfaces while following "Best Practices".
