You must be connected to the Internet to open an app the first time. Citrix Receiver for Windows installs some apps on your device so you can run them when not connected to the Internet. This installation might take several minutes.

**Note**: Offline access is not available for all users or apps. Your administrator determines how long you can use an app offline before you are required to connect to the Internet.
