If it is available in your company, Single Sign-on’s Account Self-Service feature gives you the ability to:

* Unlock your Windows account if you receive a message stating that it is locked
* Reset your Windows account password if you forgot it and cannot log on to your computer. 

The Account Self-Service button is available from the **Switch Users** screen (for Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2) or **Log On to Windows** and **Unlock Computer** dialog boxes (for other supported Windows operating systems). Clicking this button starts the Account Self-Service Wizard.

With Account Self-Service, you can now resolve these issues yourself, rather than call your company’s computer help desk.

**Important**: When using Account Self-Service, you will be asked to confirm your identity by providing the answers to your Single Sign-on security questions. If you do not know the answers to your security question, call your company’s computer help desk to unlock your Windows account or reset your Windows password.
