At times, during the course of your work, you might want to temporarily pause Single Sign-on. Reasons to pause include:

* Working on a logon page without getting logged on to the program or Web site
* Working on the Internet without being asked to store logon information each time Single Sign-on detects a logon form

Pausing is different from exiting in that Single Sign-on and its features are still running and available. You are not, however, automatically logged on to password-protected programs or Web sites and you are not prompted to store new logon information. Single Sign-on can be quickly resumed, though, when you are ready to use it.

## To pause Single sign-on:

In the Microsoft Windows notification area, typically at the far right of the taskbar, right-click the Citrix Receiver icon and select **Passwords** > **Pause Single Sign-On**.

## To determine if Single sign-on is paused:

In the Microsoft Windows notification area, typically at the far right of the taskbar, right-click the Citrix Receiver icon and select **Preferences** and view the status of the Citrix Single Sign-on Plug-in the Citrix Receiver Preferences window.

## To resume Single sign-on:

In the Microsoft Windows notification area, typically at the far right of the taskbar, right-click the Citrix Receiver icon and select **Passwords** > **Resume Single Sign-On**.
