If your company made this feature available, Single sign-on allows you to view your passwords.

**Note**: Your company may have identified certain passwords that cannot be revealed.

**Caution**: Do not allow others to learn your passwords. Doing so puts your accounts and company systems at risk.

1. In the Microsoft Windows notification area, typically at the far right of the taskbar, right-click the Citrix Receiver icon and select **Passwords** > **Manage Passwords**.
1. In the Manage Passwords window, select the desired program or Web site and click **Reveal Password**. A new dialog box appears containing the password for the selected program.
**Note**: Your company might have activated an identity verification process at this point. If so, enter your Windows user name and password when prompted. (If you log on using smart card or other authentication method that does not require a user name and password, use that to verify your identity when prompted.)
1. Click **OK** to close the programâ€™s password dialog box.
