Depending on how your company sets it up, Citrix Single Sign-on starts automatically, either when you log on to your computer or when you start your first password-protected program or Web site.

If your company configured Single Sign-on to gather information from you as it runs for the first time, you may be asked to answers to security questions, such as “Who was your favorite teacher?” Your answer to these questions will help verify your identity if necessary.
