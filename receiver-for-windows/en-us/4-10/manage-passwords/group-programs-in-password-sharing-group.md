Password sharing groups are created by your administrator. When a program is part of a password sharing group, the password used for that program matches the password for all other programs within the group. This allows you to update your password for all the programs in the group at once.

For example, if your administrator has created a password sharing group that includes your email, accounting, word processing, data entry, and human resources applications, you can change your password once and the password will be updated across the entire group.

If you use two different user names for a program within a password sharing group, you may need two different passwords as well. You can remove the logon information with the different password from its password sharing group, and any updates to that logon information will no longer affect other stored passwords for programs within the group. 

## To change a shared password 

1. In the Microsoft Windows notification area, typically at the far right of the taskbar, right-click the Citrix Receiver icon and select **Passwords** > **Manage Passwords**.
1. In the Manage Passwords window, select the desired program or Web site and click **Edit**.
**Note**: Your company might have activated an identity verification process at this point. If so, enter your Windows user name and password when prompted. (If you log on using smart card or other authentication method that does not require a user name and password, use that to verify your identity when prompted.) If the program is part of a password sharing group, the dialog box that appears includes the **Change the password for this password sharing group** link.
1. Click **Change the password for this password sharing group** and follow the directions in the wizard. 

## To disassociate a program from a password sharing group 

1. In the Microsoft Windows notification area, typically at the far right of the taskbar, right-click the Citrix Receiver icon and select **Passwords** > **Manage Passwords**.
1. In the Manage Passwords window, select the desired program or Web site and click **Edit**.
**Note**: Your company might have activated an identity verification process at this point. If so, enter your Windows user name and password when prompted. (If you log on using smart card or other authentication method that does not require a user name and password, use that to verify your identity when prompted.)
1. If the program is part of a password sharing group, the dialog box that appears includes the **Disassociate this logon from the password sharing group link**.
Click **Disassociate this logon from the password sharing group** and follow the directions in the wizard.
