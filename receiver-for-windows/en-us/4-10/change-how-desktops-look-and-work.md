Your virtual desktop is displayed in a window. Use the buttons on the window's toolbar to move and resize the desktop and to control how files and devices are accessed. A small toolbar grip button is displayed at the top of the window or (if maximized) the screen. Click the grip to display the toolbar.

## To move the toolbar to another position on the screen

You can move the toolbar to a convenient position that does not obscure other window's content or controls.

* Click the toolbar grip that appears at the top of the window or screen, and move it left or right.

## To control how local files are accessed

A virtual desktop may need to access files on your local computer. You can control the extent to which this happens.

1. On the toolbar, click **Preferences** > **File Access** and select one of the following options:
    
    | Option | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Read and write** | Allow the virtual desktop to read and write to local files.|
    | **Read only** | Allow the virtual desktop to read but not write to local files. |
    | **No access** | Do not allow the virtual desktop to access local files. |
    | **Ask me each time** | Display a prompt each time the virtual desktop needs to access local files. |

2. Click OK.

## To set up a microphone or webcam

Follow this procedure if you want to change the way your virtual desktop accesses a local microphone or webcam.

1. On the toolbar, click **Preferences** > **Connections**, and select one of the following options:
    
    | Option | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Connect automatically**	| Allow the microphone or webcam to be used on the virtual desktop. |
    | **Do not connect** | Do not allow the microphone or webcam to be used on the virtual desktop. |
    | **Ask me** | Prompt me when the virtual desktop needs to access the microphone or webcam. |

2. In **Global Settings** select your **Preferred Webcam**.
3. Click **OK**.

**Limitation:**

* The Preferred Webcam dialog displays in the Citrix Connection Center even when the Windows Media Redirection policy is set to **Disabled** in the Desktop Delivery Controller.
